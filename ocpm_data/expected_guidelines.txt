## **Implementation and Automation**### Comprehensive Mortgage Processing Guidelines

This structured set of guidelines is designed to serve as a benchmark for evaluating real-world mortgage origination, underwriting, and servicing workflows. Each category includes actionable, measurable standards to ensure compliance, operational efficiency, and adaptability to automated system checks.

---

### **1. Compliance & Regulatory Adherence**
#### **Key Guidelines**
1. **Regulatory Alignment**:
   - Ensure compliance with federal regulations such as **TILA-RESPA**, **HMDA**, **ECOA**, **Fair Housing Act**, and **ATR/QM**.
   - Implement automated checks for regulatory compliance using tools like Encompass, HMDA Wiz, or AUS systems.

2. **Mandatory Documentation**:
   - Collect and maintain all required borrower demographic data (race, ethnicity, gender, income) per HMDA guidelines.
   - Provide clear and timely disclosures (e.g., Loan Estimate within 3 business days of application).

3. **Reporting Standards**:
   - Submit HMDA Loan Application Register (LAR) data by March 1st annually or quarterly if applicable.
   - Conduct regular audits to ensure data integrity and compliance with reporting deadlines.

4. **Audit Requirements**:
   - Maintain an audit trail of all loan lifecycle activities, including timestamps for disclosures and communications.
   - Conduct periodic internal audits to identify compliance gaps and mitigate risks.

#### **Examples**
- **Compliant Scenario**: HMDA data submitted accurately and on time, with no missing fields or demographic data.
- **Non-Compliant Scenario**: Failure to disclose fees within 3 business days, resulting in regulatory penalties.

---

### **2. Pre-Approval Risk Management**
#### **Key Guidelines**
1. **Credit Assessment**:
   - Establish minimum credit score thresholds based on investor guidelines (e.g., Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac).
   - Use AUS systems (e.g., Desktop Underwriter®) to validate creditworthiness.

2. **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio**:
   - Ensure DTI ratios do not exceed 43% for ATR/QM compliance unless compensating factors are documented.

3. **Borrower Verification**:
   - Verify income using pay stubs, tax returns, and employer verification.
   - Validate assets via bank statements and ensure sufficient reserves for closing costs and down payment.

4. **Fraud Prevention**:
   - Utilize fraud detection tools (e.g., LexisNexis Risk Solutions) to identify discrepancies in borrower information.

#### **Examples**
- **Compliant Scenario**: Borrower's income verified with tax returns and employer confirmation; DTI ratio calculated accurately.
- **Non-Compliant Scenario**: Loan pre-approved based on unverified income, leading to default risk.

### **3. Loan Origination Protocols**
#### **Key Guidelines**
1. **Rate Locking**:
   - Provide borrowers with clear rate lock agreements, including expiration dates and terms.
   - Document rate lock changes and ensure compliance with pricing policies.

2. **Disclosure Delivery**:
   - Deliver Loan Estimate (LE) and Closing Disclosure (CD) within required timelines (e.g., LE within 3 business days of application, CD at least 3 business days before closing).

3. **Application Timestamping**:
   - Timestamp all loan applications and disclosures to ensure adherence to regulatory deadlines.

4. **Fee Calculations**:
   - Ensure fees comply with TILA guidelines and avoid predatory lending practices.
   - Cap origination fees at reasonable levels (e.g., 3% of loan amount for ATR/QM compliance).

#### **Examples**
- **Compliant Scenario**: Loan Estimate delivered within 3 business days; rate lock terms documented and disclosed.
- **Non-Compliant Scenario**: Fees exceed ATR/QM thresholds, or disclosures are delayed.

---

### **4. Underwriting & Closing**
#### **Key Guidelines**
1. **Appraisal Standards**:
   - Ensure appraisals comply with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP).
   - Validate property value against loan amount to meet Loan-to-Value (LTV) thresholds.

2. **Title Verification**:
   - Conduct thorough title searches to identify liens, encumbrances, or ownership disputes.

3. **Closing Procedures**:
   - Prepare and deliver closing documents (e.g., Note, Mortgage/Deed of Trust) accurately and on time.
   - Ensure borrowers receive Closing Disclosure at least 3 business days before closing.

4. **Condition Clearing**:

#### **Examples**
- **Compliant Scenario**: Title search completed, appraisal meets USPAP standards, and Closing Disclosure delivered on time.
- **Non-Compliant Scenario**: Loan closed without clearing underwriting conditions, leading to post-closing issues.
