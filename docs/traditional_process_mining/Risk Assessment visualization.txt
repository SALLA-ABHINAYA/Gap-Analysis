This is the Risk Assessment visualization from the code, specifically generated by the visualize_risk_distribution function in app.py and calculated using the ProcessRiskAnalyzer and EnhancedFMEA classes in risk_analysis.py. Let me break down what you're seeing:

Main Metrics at Top:


Total Risks Identified: 69 (indicates total number of potential failure points/risks found in the process)
Average Risk Priority Number (RPN): 147.68 (average risk severity across all identified risks)


Risk Distribution Matrix:


X-axis: Severity (4-8 scale) - How serious the impact would be if the risk occurs
Y-axis: Likelihood (2-10 scale) - How likely the risk is to occur
Color Gradient:

Yellow: Higher RPN (Risk Priority Number)
Blue: Medium RPN
Purple: Lower RPN




Hover Example Shown:

CopyActivity: Decision point failure at gateway
Severity: 6.00
Likelihood: 3.00
RPN: 126.00
The calculations behind this visualization come from risk_analysis.py:

Risk Identification:

pythonCopydef analyze_bpmn_graph(self):
    # Analyzes BPMN nodes to identify potential risks
    # For gateways, tasks, subprocesses, etc.
    self.failure_modes.append(FailureMode(
        node_id=str(node.get_id()),
        node_type="ExclusiveGateway",
        description=f"Decision point failure at gateway {node.get_name()}",
        historical_frequency=0.3
    ))

RPN Calculation:

pythonCopydef assess_risk(self) -> List[Dict]:
    # For each failure mode:
    severity = self.calculate_severity(failure_mode)
    likelihood = self.calculate_likelihood(failure_mode)
    detectability = self.calculate_detectability(failure_mode)
    rpn = severity * likelihood * detectability

Severity Calculation:

pythonCopydef calculate_severity(self, failure_mode: FailureMode) -> int:
    base_severity = {
        'Task': 5,
        'SubProcess': 7,
        'ExclusiveGateway': 6,
        'ParallelGateway': 4,
        'ComplexGateway': 8
    }.get(failure_mode.node_type, 5)

The Visualization:

pythonCopydef visualize_risk_distribution(risk_assessment_results):
    fig = go.Figure()
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
        x=severities,
        y=likelihoods,
        mode='markers',
        marker=dict(
            size=[r['rpn'] * 5 for r in risk_assessment_results],
            color=rpn_values,
            colorscale='Viridis'
        )
    ))
The purpose of this visualization is to:

Show the distribution of risks across severity and likelihood
Identify high-risk areas (yellow regions)
Highlight potential process vulnerabilities
Guide process improvement efforts

This helps process owners:

Identify which parts of the process need immediate attention
Understand the overall risk profile of their process
Prioritize improvement efforts
Track risk levels over time

The example point shown (RPN: 126.00) indicates a moderate risk at a decision gateway, suggesting that while it needs attention, it's not among the highest-risk elements in the process.
